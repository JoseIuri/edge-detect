# Edge Detection

Sobel edge detection algorithms implemented in Python for grayscale images.

This project intends to serve as a Golden Model for future Stochastic Computing applications.

Current Status:
* General Sobel filtering is done, tweaks should be made for proper functioning
* Ground-truth based on [K. Bowyer, C. Kranenburg, and S. Dougherty, "Edge Detector Evaluation
   Using Empirical ROC Curves", Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition '99, 
   Fort Collins, Colorado. Vol 1, pp 354-359. June 1999.](http://figment.csee.usf.edu/edge/roc/)
