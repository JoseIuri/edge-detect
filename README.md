# Edge Detection

Sobel edge detection algorithms implemented in Python for grayscale images.

This project intends to serve as a Golden Model for future Stochastic Computing applications.

Current Status:
* Conventional Sobel filter implemented
* Image database for testing from [K. Bowyer, C. Kranenburg, and S. Dougherty, "Edge Detector Evaluation
   Using Empirical ROC Curves", Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition '99, 
   Fort Collins, Colorado. Vol 1, pp 354-359. June 1999.](http://figment.csee.usf.edu/edge/roc/)
   
Python dependencies:
* Python 3.6.7
* opencv, matplotlib and numpy

Installation recommendation:
* Newer version of Python 3 (like 3.6.x) come with pip preinstalled. Pip is a simple package manager for Python (normally aliased as pip3)
* For this project:
```bash
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install opencv-python
pip3 install matplotlib
```
