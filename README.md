# Edge Detection

Sobel edge detection algorithms implemented in Python for grayscale images.

This project intends to serve as a Golden Model for future Stochastic Computing applications.

Current Status:
* Conventional Sobel filter implemented
* Image database for testing from [K. Bowyer, C. Kranenburg, and S. Dougherty, "Edge Detector Evaluation
